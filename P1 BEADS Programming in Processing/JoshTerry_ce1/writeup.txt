If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:

I added Low- and High-Pass filters between the source and the gain UGen.
These allow the user to make the horn sound more drowned out or tinny, based on slider modification.
Higher gain = louder, lower gain = quieter
Lower LP Filter = lower presence of higher frequencies for a more "drowned out" sound.
Higher HP Filter = lower presence of lower frequencies for a more "tinny" sound.
