Class Exercise 4 writeup

For this exercise, I created an audio tape reel-to-reel visualization with play, stop, reset, reverse, fast-forward, playhead scrubbing, music volume sliding, and foley volume sliding functionality. Every time a button is pressed, its respective sound effect fires. The playhead is disallowed from being less than zero or greater than the length of the music via a check in the program's draw method.

Buttons
    Play - Sets playback to 1.0 rate and begins playback.
    Stop - Stops playback at current position.
    Reset - Stops playback and resets playhead to beginning of music.
    Reverse - Sets playback to -2.0 rate and begins playback.
    Fast Forward - Sets playback to 2.0 rate and begins playback.

Sliders
    Playhead Slider - Displays seconds of the music played.
                      Click and drag to adjust playhead location.
    Music Volume - Click and drag to adjust music volume.
    Foley Volume - Click and drag to adjust foley volume.

Extra features
    - Tape visualizer in which reels rotate and tape moves done using PShapes and some trigonometry based on playhead position.
    - Playhead slider to view and manipulate playhead position.
    - Aesthetically pleasing background and fairly intuitive button layout designed by me using Processing and Photoshop.
    - Multiple distinct, thematically consistent sound effects, all from one source file of me making a popping noise with my mouth.
    - Currently active buttons remain highlighted
    - Music volume and foley volume sliders.

Challenges
    - Had implemented slider noises, but they always fired upon startup. Seeing as the exercise only requires button SFX, I opted to not include slider noises to maintain polish.
    - The tape reel isn't perfect. I draw a line between the bottom of each circle, rather than a tangent line between the two circles. This isn't as pretty, but is much simpler and less expensive for the computer to figure out.
    - The number to the right of the music and foley volume sliders looks a bit rough, but it doesn't like not drawing.
